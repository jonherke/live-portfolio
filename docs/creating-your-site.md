# Creating your site

After you've [installed][1] Material for MkDocs, you can bootstrap your project 
documentation using the `mkdocs` executable. Go to the directory where you want
your project to be located and enter:

```
mkdocs new .
```

Alternatively, if you're running Material for MkDocs from within Docker, use:

=== "Unix"

    ```
    docker run --rm -it -v ${PWD}:/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material new .
    ```

=== "Windows"

    ```
    docker run --rm -it -v "%cd%":/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material new .
    ```

This will create the following structure:

```
.
├─ docs/
│  └─ index.md
└─ mkdocs.yml
```

Depending on your [installation method][2], you can now add the following lines
to `mkdocs.yml` in your project root. If you installed Material for MkDocs using
`pip` or `docker`, add:

``` yaml
theme:
  name: material
```

If you cloned Material for MkDocs from GitHub, add:

``` yaml
theme:
  name: null

## Previewing as you write

MkDocs includes a live preview server, so you can preview your changes as you
write your documentation. The server will automatically rebuild the site upon
saving. Start it with:

```
mkdocs serve
```

If you're running Material for MkDocs from within Docker, use:

=== "Unix"

    ```
    docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v ${PWD}:/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material
    ```

=== "Windows"

    ```
    docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v "%cd%":/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material
    ```

Point your browser to [localhost:8000][15] and you should see:

[![Creating your site][16]][15]

## Building your site

When you're finished editing, you can build a static site from your Markdown
files with:

```
mkdocs build
```

The contents of this directory make up your project documentation. There's no
need for operating a database or server, as it is completely self-contained.
The site can be hosted on [GitHub Pages][17], [GitLab Pages][18], a CDN of your
choice or your private web space.
