that _new features are first exclusively released to sponsors_ as part of
__Material for MkDocs Insiders__. Read on to learn [how sponsorship works][2],
and how you can [become a sponsor][3].

## How sponsorship works

New features will first land in Material for MkDocs Insiders, which means that
_sponsors will have access immediately_. Every feature is tied to a funding
goal in monthly subscriptions. If a funding goal is hit, the features that are
tied to it are merged back into Material for MkDocs and released for general
availability. Bugfixes will always be released simultaneously in both editions.

See the [roadmap][4] for a list of already available and upcoming features, and
for demonstration purposes, [the official documentation][5] built with Material
for MkDocs Insiders.
