## NLP Bibliometrics

=== "Description"

    Digital research publications are the bread and butter of the contemporary researcher. They are the source of new ideas and provide the background to all good research project. The problem we have today is that we have too many of these papers coming available at a near exponential rate. This shear volume of information has left the conventional keyword search, research daisy-chain method used up to this point obsolete. What we need is a new way of preprocessing the data available to us, so that we can make more intelligent decisions regarding our research. Artifical Intelligence, along with Graph, can be used as a solution.
