# Projects

## MedGraph

Find all data that has any relevance to the medical space and bring that data together in one place. The ability to build a system that is automatically pulling together data from multiple sources along with running real time analytics whilst allowing users to interact with the platform from a Graphical User Interface.

**Project Objectives**
* Build out the largest Medical Graph from open domain knowledge
* Make the knowledge and insights available via APIs and Visualizations
* Build new emerging & technology skills
* Build credibility through actual project work that has actual impact on society
* Build a portfolio of project examples
* Have a direct impact on individuals lives in the community

## Robotic Assistant
Tech stack for this project:
=== "Software"
    * ROS/Python for logic and interaction with robot simulation in Gazebo and raspberry pi (using https://rds.theconstructsim.com/ for simulation and ROS workspace)
    * Node-red for interfacing with ROS from Alexa or other voice-command apis, possible joystick/phone control, and other control methods to send information

=== "Hardware/Sim"
    * Fusion 360 for CAD model for arm from How To Mechatronics website/YT for real-life model https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/diy-arduino-robot-arm-with-smartphone-control/
    * CAD model is converted to URDF for visualization in Gazebo
    * Raspberry PI 3 B+ microcontroller
    * 5 DOF robot arm
